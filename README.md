# MorpheusCodingChallenges

Java-Maven project that helps Java-Developers solve challenges by [Morpheus Tutorials].

## Description
This (java-maven) project is based on the challenges from [add morpheus link]. It is a base for 
Java developers that includes sending Http Requests, parsing Json and benchmarking the challenges.
The purpose is to let the developers concentrate on solving the challenges without having to worry 
about the rest. Furthermore it cleans up the code since the classes where the challenges are getting solved only 
contain a constructor and one method that solves the challenge.
